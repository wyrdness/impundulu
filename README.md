## Overview

The **Impundulu**, or **Lightning Bird**, is a creature from Zulu, Xhosa, and Pondo folklore in South Africa. Described as a **large bird** (size of a human in some accounts), it serves as a familiar to witches and has the power to **control and summon lightning**.

The witch sends the impundulu to attack enemies via lightning strikes. The creature can **shape-shift** into the form of a handsome man to seduce women, and it has **vampiric qualities**, drinking blood from victims.

The impundulu has a symbiotic relationship with its witch, including sexual relations, and is **passed down from mother to daughter** as an inherited familiar. Detection of an impundulu involves lightning striking the same place repeatedly or unexplained lightning patterns.

This is a **serious belief** in Zulu and Xhosa cultures, part of the broader system of beliefs about witchcraft and supernatural power.
