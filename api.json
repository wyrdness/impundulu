      "full": "The Impundulu, or Lightning Bird, is a creature from Zulu, Xhosa, and Pondo folklore in South Africa. Described as a large bird (size of a human in some accounts), it serves as a familiar to witches and has the power to control and summon lightning. The witch sends the impundulu to attack enemies via lightning strikes. The creature can shape-shift into the form of a handsome man to seduce women, and it has vampiric qualities, drinking blood from victims. The impundulu has a symbiotic relationship with its witch, including sexual relations, and is passed down from mother to daughter as an inherited familiar. Detection of an impundulu involves lightning striking the same place repeatedly or unexplained lightning patterns. This is a serious belief in Zulu and Xhosa cultures, part of the broader system of beliefs about witchcraft and supernatural power. The impundulu represents the dangerous intersection of natural phenomena (lightning), witchcraft, and supernatural entities."
